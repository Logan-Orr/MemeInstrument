# MemeInstrument
A instrument for GarageBand, or other DAWS you can use it by drag and dropping the patch file into the track column where the instruments are
This is a instrument, made by using the AUSampler inside of garage bands plugins, I have only added 10 sounds, more will be to come, you can give some suggestions, question, comments, or tips, I have not tested this on FL Studio, it should work though, I have used sound from the site https://myinstants.com
This is a very useful site, allows you to test sounds easily in a instant(no pun intended), and you should check it out!
I also may make a youtube video on how I made it, or you can google search AUSampler, How to Create Instrument.
BYE!
